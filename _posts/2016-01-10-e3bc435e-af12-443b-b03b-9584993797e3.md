**Exploration:** What is the world going to be like and what is my place?
![Can You See The International Space Station From Earth](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3c4b335bb6096767060833588ea0b89f1fcae934.jpg)

AI has already begun to automate more front-line consumer processes... redefining [work][0], play & even how we live our lives.  The ubiquity of the implementation of technology and big data into all aspects of life as we know it is fast becoming commonplace and the new default; embedded sensors in the everywhere we go, on our bodies and in our clothes: tracking our biorhythms, decisions and behavioral patterns --- all aspects of life. 

Advances in clean tech, renewable energy and sustainability initiatives will begin to reduce our reliance on traditional sources of power generation. Instead most of our energy needs could come from micro-scale renewable power generators. Breakthroughs in how researchers think about maintaining homeostasis and wellness will lead to new ways in how physicians diagnose and treat diseases.   
The sharing economy will expand to all touch points of daily life, where people will care less about outright ownership but rather shifts to concern about memberships and the quality of experiences provided along the way. Perhaps after establishing some sense of permanence and privacy of place, the spaces where we live will soon be populated by shared commodities based on our stage of life, professional and personal needs, why even bother to buy kitchen appliances, utensils, furniture, work clothes, casual wear and more when these can all be allocated to fit your needs.   
Could this create a new gap between the makers and consumers? Would this highly customized level of specificity help eliminate fear and worry about the most basic of living necessities or would it just serve to highlight the inequality of a small but emerging class of nouveau entrepreneurs amidst the masses of consumerism.  I still think the economic success of nations is going to be measured by the levels of advancements made in their respective fields of research and development and the resulting implementation through startups. Increasingly, conflicts are going to be issues of cyber security in gaining access to the masses, especially in wrangling control of the messaging and narrative in experiences. Specialized groups will still persist in seeking access to research insights and emerging technologies in a bid to gain the upper hand.

My singular objective is still to mentor people looking for new pathways, especially those who are ready to go, together we will help them achieve escape velocity as they scale and grown. These are the ones who take ownership of the challenges they seek to solve,  they are passionate about what they do and are motivated to succeed even in the face of failure. We will equip them with the critical tools necessary to prevail, ensuring knowledge succession, so that the cycle of innovation continues to shape the future as we grow in community.

To accomplish this, I am launching "ThingkLabs" around the world to educate and accelerate. Some key areas include the exploration on the intricacies of why humans innately crave attention and to understand at the very core, what it means to be human. Focusing on these, the research explores how deeper and more meaningful connections are formed in relationships and the concerted effort required to cultivate them.  
Learning from these, we press on to build and shape more intuitive and natural experiences where the learning curve of technology is eliminated and instead, technology and data accelerate sight unseen adapting and conforming to each of our highly personalized preferences.
